Module 5 Challenge
Got help from a tutor.  Location is pymaceuticals_starter-Copy1.ipynb.

Three observations: 
1.  Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective medications to decrease the tumor voume size in mice.
2.  Looking at the line plot of tumor volume vs time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin, it appears as though
   the medication starts to kick in in 20 days.  After that point, is when the tumor size starts to decrease, in that singular
mouse's case at least, it decreased by about 20% within two weeks, and then there was another increase in tumor size again.  This may indicate the need for a change in dosage or another strategy to continue to decrease the size of the tumor.
3.  There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the mouse's weight and the average tumor volume (.84),
   this would perhaps indicate that a diet with a caloric deficit, should be compounded with the medication regimen
 to decrease the size of the tumor sites.
